            <p>Our users are struggling to find affordable and available parking in
                major cities. Our solution to this should provide users with available parking
                and the rate for parking at that specific place, because everyone's budget for
                parking will differ.</p>

            <p>We used our group brain power on Jamboard to make a list of the problems, details, and typical users our app would work along side of. This allowed us to put out thoughts out in the open and a place to look back at them. </p>
